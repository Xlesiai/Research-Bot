### ~~Generalized Logs~~ ~
- [X] fix backslash and forward slashes
- [ ] check if forward slash (/) is from cuckoo
- [X] percentage or avg performance
  - since it's hard to see which would be better

### ~~Document why we are using Generalized ET/SVM for cuckoo logs~~ ~
  - We tested the performance of Normal, Pre-Encrypted, Generalized, and Removed Logs and XXX work the best for us. 

### ~~Confirm @Please_Read_Me@.txt~~

### Continue Spam Detection
- help integrate tf-idf across different documents

### ~~Removing Cuckoo files from the cuckoo logs~~

### Probabilities and Threshold
- [ ] Combine probabilities (avg) to gain a better result
- [ ] Compare Probabilities (Log, PCAP, Avg)
- [X] Set a threshold for Infected or Benign

### Check how the estimators are used in the stacking classifier
